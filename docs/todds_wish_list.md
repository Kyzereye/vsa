# Todd's Wish List

A list of requested features and ideas. Responses (e.g. status or follow-up) are noted under each item when available.

---

**Instructor drop down under name where instructors can list their NRA Instructor Number and current certifications (maybe even upload their certs too)**

**Board Member drop down under name where board members can have their position identified**
- done

**An org chart that shows all board members and appointed positions**
- done - Admins have the ability to assign, edit, and delete people from positions.

**A copy of the bylaws that can only be accessed by Board members**
- there is a dumbie copy of the bylaws below the board members

**Limit general acces of website to events, programs and gallery**
- what about "about" and membership

**Have an option to choose and display whether a member is current (maybe just 2 or 3 people having the ability to change a members status)**
- This is done in the admin users management panel

**An instructor page that can only be accessed by instructors where files and comments can be shared**

**Online Waiver forms.  Like the online membership form**

**Set the website up as a backup to WIX initially in case WIX goes down**
- This is unnecessary. Wix is not going to go down, and if it does, the repercussions are limited.

**A state listing of VSA chapters and the POC for each chapter**
- Done - Our Community.  

**Potentially have links to Teams, Trello, Signal and Zoom through the board member access**

**A secure folder for board members to upload and download documents**

**Streaming access to Blink security systems or other CCTV**

**I know colleges can do this, but have a way to mass text members that opt in for messaging**
-Yes, this can be done.

**Add NRA member number to each profile**
- Is this for all memebers or just instructors?

**A button or link on the main page to the existing websites for VSA and Shredvets**
- Done - Our Community.  

**You can eliminate past events**
- they are gone, but can be turned back on easily

**Add a projects page that members can access and add comments or pics**

**Having a Colorado Chapter for the VSA and ShredVets would be awesome... so if you decide to take the lead on that, you can set up a CO website for it**
- Thanks, but I am not looking to invest that much time. 

**When you get on Signal, send me a PM on there**
- Done

**Thanks for your help on this project!**
- Glad I could help :)
